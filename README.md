# sara---a-medical-assistant

#It is a medical assisstant that is built using simple AI functionalities and basic library modules;

#This assistant has a limitless options and can be expanded to various fields of science and Tech and can be implimented with efficeiency by right devolpment and updates

#The assistant in cable of(till now):

->capture the image of the patient/usr and store it in a .jpg format in directory.

->can search deaseses from open-source likely, from wikipedia and provide a short summary about it.

->text-to-speech capabilities with basic python functionalities.

->Convert the give informayion in document format and save it in directory.

The virtual assistant is been made on the ocassion of hackathon event commenced at IIT Dharwad, Parsec 4.0. The assistant is simple to use and easy to work and update too.


Use:
-->Just run the script using any Python supported IDE or prompts.

-->**for errorless run, one must have all the repository to be downloaded:

->wikipedia

->pyttsx3

->datetime

->speechRrecognition

->googletrans

->cv2

->docx

to download repositoary just state, pip install <repositoary_name> {given above}....and all set.

The tool has limiless advantages as mentioned above and can be implimented in various feild for different operaions using right repositaries and code, feel free to drop comments.all feedback and devolpments are accepted.

-> we had a wonderful toime in creating the project here in hackathon...do check:

The code is built using Python, openAI , and in-built directories of python as given above.

->Devolpments that can be added:
Various developments can be added in this AI system to make it better the features include gender detection,face analyzer, age detector, can be merged to a valid information source of medical feild and grasp the information from there in order to process it to give a final output. we can also add an attractive front end for better user experience and the back end for storage of the data efficiently and effectively by proper development of the code you can also retrieve delete or modify the data for complete error minimization procedure. We try to implement the speech converter which helps in conversion of the languages used in local area and convert to to the general language for query simplification
